# Basic Server for File Uploading

just a little side project I'm gonna be doing while I'm learning Java.

Currently it's just one way communication - Client says stuff to server. Going to try to add 2 way communication later.

To use, just 
git clone https://github.com/exie1122/Basic-Java-Server.git
then, on whatever device you want to run the server on (say, a raspberry pi zero 2w), run the java script
In the terminal or IDE of the server, you'll see "Server has been started on" + (your port)
then just run the client script on your client device, and you'll see the connected message once the client connects
