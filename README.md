# Basic Server for File Uploading

just a little side project I'm gonna be doing while I'm learning Java.

Currently it's just one way communication - Client says stuff to server. Going to try to add 2 way communication later.

To use, just 
git clone https://github.com/exie1122/Basic-Java-Server.git
